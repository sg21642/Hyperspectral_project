## The integrity of pre recorded data 
The set of data is provided by the cognitive research group at university of Tuebingen. Although it is a great source material, the integrity of the data is a mystery. The biggest problem is the how they recorded the data. There had been some mention about some rule of the data like measuring the temperature of the environment. The research group hasn't mentioned any of the measurements or setting for the camera they have used for the measurement. it is an issue when recording data as it is obvious that the recorded data will be different.

## The recorded data 
The data that is recorded using specim fx10e is has the following setting to produce an output which is genuine and authentic. It has the following setting of the camera and recorded at room temperature. 
Frame rate = 135 fps 
Exposure time = 3.2 s
spectral binning = 2 
spatial binning = 4 

field of view = 90

This is used to create images with 256 by 456+. The live waterfall display in view widget wasn't working meaning the images with avocados are not efficiant. The problem is that the image boundries are not determined with bounding box rather estimation.

the avocados captured are not the brought from the supplier, rathar from a supermarket and they are indivdually selected for the unripe stage. This mean the data wasn't fully acurrate.
