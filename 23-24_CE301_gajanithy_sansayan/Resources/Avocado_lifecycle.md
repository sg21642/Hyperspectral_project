## Why avocados?
Fruits go colour changes as they ripen, by some fruits goes subtle colour changes, making it not visible for a human eye to identify the maturity. Avocados are type of climatric fruit, which ripens even after they are harvested. This mean a identiying matrity of the fruit may be challenging but in a lab environment it can be observed. Also avocados are mass consumed. 

## the life cycle and factors 
Avocados grows in rigions of the world like latin America, asia and parts of Africa and exported to rest of the globe after harvest. They are classifyed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with features that were segmented. These include variety, class, and quality. The higer quality and the most popular varities are predominantly exported to the western world. 

Typically, it take around a week for avocados to ripen after harvest and they produce ethylene gas, which affect the rate of ripening. Usually avocados are harvested and exported around 1-2 days to markets. The life cycle of avocados can be divided into 3 stages, unripe, ripe ,and overripe. The following diagram show the life cycle across 9 days. beyond that avocados are deemed to be rotten.

The ethlyne gas it produces determine the rate of ripening. the more the ethylene is released, the faster the ripening is. The are conventional method, which affect the rate in which the fruit ripen at home such as covering it with brown paper or placing it next to other fruits. There are other factors which also affects the rate like shape, variey and more. This makes it challenging for the fruit to be analysed. 

## the set of data. 
During recording, avocados are brough on the day as ripen at home ones and it the measured across the days for spectal information.Overall, the recorded data is defined by set. Thse set consists of the popular variety of Hass and 5 fruits were broughts and measured on both front and back sides each days at the exact same settings.
