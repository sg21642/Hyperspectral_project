# Weekly Log
## Week 2 (challenge week)
Challenge week had me introduce with me to the project and I had meeting with the project supervisor for first time officially regarding the project. We had a conversation of what must be done for the challenge week. After the meeting, the supervisor wrote me an email regarding the brief of the project and what to commence on the challenge week. I have instructed to gain more background reading and complete all the set up for the project.Then I should try getting information into spectral python.
The initial setup of the software tools such as venv and spectral, Pillow and matplotlib packages has been installed. Using jupyter notebooks rather than pylab. When trying to export image files into spectral python, I found difficulties. In the process, I understood how an spectral data from the imager is formatted. 
## Week 3-4
At the start, had a meeting with the module supervisor, Adrian Clark, who introduced to me with Dr Nick Warren and constructed an email for risk assessment to be created and signed off that I can gain access to the imager. I started reading documentation on the imager and its operation. During week 4, I had meeting with supervisor and stated that imager risk assessment will be signed off and provided me with the official manuals for the Spacim fx10e, which includes imager, scanner and SDK. I also had the imager installation packages of the SDK and scanner. I had a look at the imager manual and started reading the SDK manual.

## Week 5
I had high hopes in this week on the imager access to be given so that the chapter 2 and chapter 3 fully commence. All in vain as the supervisor told me that the imager access may be delayed further. I made very good advancement in this week on my full reading on the imager SDK. During the reading, I had understood that the project should not be using the SDK due to time constraints and the there has to be verification need to be completed with Spacim to use the image. This process could take weeks or months to be done.Further SDK is also bind to a single Computer meaning access outside hours is not viable.
I also made reading on the LUMO scanner as this will be used record my own data and exporting it.I installed the LUMO scanner to have a look at the interface. Further I read and watched tutorial on the LUMO scanner by Spacim. 
## Week 6
As the imager access could take a lot of time, I had to push back some of my chapter on the imager operation and recording and make modification to start analysis 1 immediately. I spend the week on documenting and making changes to make spectral analysis with the pre recorded data. 
## Week 7 - 8
I have now changed my focus to exporting images into spectral python. I have started with taking a spectral information files into spectral python. I understood that the files are envi supported and should be  opened with the envi call. the image information is then to be loaded as a object array. A envi format contains a header file with the valuable definition of the image and a binary file which contains information of each pixels. I then used this data loaded to conduct some experiments to familiarise my self with spectral python. I used matplotlib to plot data of the image with K-means algorithm. 
## Week 9 - 10
I had a meeting with my supervisor and I stated that I am trying generate a GIF/ animation using matplotlib and pillow to visualise and understand the image data. In this process, he explained me that there could be a deviation in the image and we should find ways to match certain region.I have instructed to reduce the image to focus on a specific region and plot information. I achieved this by specifying a region of pixel and extending the pixel region. then using matplotlib to plot and create animation of the 12 day graph using matplotlib animation framework. I then saved this as GIF using Pillow. My supervisor also stated that the imager access is delaying further as the technician want place even stricter measures to gain access. Therefore, he instructed me to have my full focus on processing and look into machine learning during the winter research.
## Week 11
